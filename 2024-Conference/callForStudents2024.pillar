from Sunday to Monday, checkout on Thursday morning). Students will be hosted in student rooms. ESUG additionally covers for the 
lunches during the week and one dinner.

Duties include handling registration as people arrive at the conference, filling coffee machines, collecting presentation slides for 
ESUG right after the presentation is given, being present at an information desk to answer questions, and generally being helpful. Student
