We invite authors of contributions related to IWST's topics, accepted for publication in Journals and Proceedings of top-rated international conferences within the previous 2 years, to submit an abstract and present their published results to the IWST workshop collocated with ESUG.

Authors of publications that meet the above criteria are invited to submit a presentation proposal to IWST organizers by filling out the web form. The proposal will consist of (1) the presentation title, (2) authors, (3) the abstract,  (4) a pointer to the original journal paper (DOI) or pre-print, and (5) an acknowledgement that the paper meets the mentioned criteria and to not break any intellectual property limitations related to the previous publication.
