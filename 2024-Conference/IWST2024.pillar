!!! Submissions, reviews, and selection

Authors interested to present their work at the IWST 2024 are invited to submit an abstract of the intended talk before the extended abstract submission deadline. The extended abstract should be not longer than 2 pages following the *CEUR ART style>https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip*.
Author of the submitted extended abstratcs will be notified and invited to present their work by the extended abstract notification deadline which enables presenters to register at the early registration prices.

IWST invites everybody to submit full/short papers to be considered to be plublished in the IWST 2024 Proceedings.
Papers can both be presented in the conference and appear in proceedings independently of the initially submitted abstracts.

We are looking for papers of two kinds:

- Short position papers (5 to 10 pages) describing fresh ideas and early results.
- Full research papers (more than 10 pages) with deeper description of experiments and of research results.

Paper accepted for publishing will be published within a *CEUR-WS Proceedings>https://ceur-ws.org/*.
Hence, both submissions and final papers must be prepared using the *CEUR ART style>https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip*. 
We recommend to use the template in single column style, although you may use two colums.
CEUR proceedings accepts papers in boths styles as soon as they use the template and have 5 or more pages.

All submissions must be sent via *EasyChair submission page>https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwst2024*.

Pay attention, for organisation constraints, when submitting your article you are expected to register to the conference and pay the conference fees. 


!!!! Reviewing

As the workshop format encourages bringing fresh ideas and early results to be presented and discussed, and aims for giving a chance to young community members to learn and grow, we will allow  submissions with a discussion potential to be conditionally accepted. In this case, authors are expected to follow the recommendations of the reviewers.

Consequently, the reviewing process will be organized in two rounds:
-in the first round, all submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. Based on these reviews authors will receive a notification with reviewers comments, advices, and requirements, and papers that are not rejected will be invited to be resubmitted in an improved form together with change log and answrers to the reviewers.
- in the second round, PC chairs in collaboration with the reviewers where needed and possible, will evaluate the improved paper version and notifiy authors about final decision on acceptance/rejection.

 
""Best Paper Award""

To encourage the submission of high-quality ideas, contributions, and papers, the IWST organizing committee is very proud to announce a Award competition in the categories of ""best idea"", ""best contribution to the community"" and ""best paper for this edition of IWST"".

The ranking will be decided by the program committee during the review process and by the audience voting during the conference. 

The awards will be given during the ESUG conference social event.

The Awards will take place only with a minimum of six submissions. Notice also that to be eligible, a paper/abstract must be presented at the workshop by one of the author and that the presenting author must be registered at the ESUG conference.
