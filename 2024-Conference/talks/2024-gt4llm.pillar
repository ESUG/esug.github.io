! gt4llm: A programmable environment for large language models

""Abstract:""
Glamorous Toolkit (GT) is an environment for exploring systems, documenting
them, and communicating about them. As such, views on objects, both technical
and for the domain, are essential. And although GT aims to make creating views
inexpensive and for them to be amortized as quickly as possible, it is still
often repetitive work. So naturally, we explored how to generate that code using
a large language model (LLM), a tool which is great at performing repetitive
work quickly. While working on this, we also created an infrastructure for
working with LLMs more generally, enabling a moldable approach to exploring the
interaction with models.

""Bio:""
Veit is a developer experience crafter at feenk (feenk.com) building tools and
techniques for making software systems explainable.
