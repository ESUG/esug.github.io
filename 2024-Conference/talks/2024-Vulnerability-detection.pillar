""Abstract:""
Object-oriented applications are prone to vulnerabilities in their code leading to attacks. These attacks, once detected, are declared in known databases such as 
Mitre (https://cve.mitre.org/) and NVD (https://nvd.nist.gov/). Based on some criteria such as the severity and the scope, these attacks are classified according to the 
Open Source Foundation for Application Security (OWASP: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) into more than 10 categories. 
In the Mitre database, there are no declared attacks against Pharo code.
Recently, we have conducted an experiment to simulate attacks on Pharo using log files as a entry point for attacks. We have succeded in carring out an attack targeting code written in Pharo.
In this talk, we will present some concepts linked to the attacks of object-oriented languages. We will, then, give a PoC and explain how the simulated attack is perfromed. 
We will conclude by giving some lessons learned and good practices to avoid this kind of attacks. 


""Bio:""
Imen is a Lecturer in Computer Science in the Evref Team and at the FST of University of Lille. 
She has obtained her Ph.D from the University of Lorraine. Her research areas include the code analysis for vulnerability detection, meta-modelling, and formal development 
of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Systems of Systems (SoS).

Steven is an Inria researcher and works in the EVREF team. 
He builds and studies debugging tools to help developers understand their programs and fix bugs.
In this context, his research interests span reflection and meta-programming, object-centric instrumentation, dynamic software adaptation and dynamic languages.
