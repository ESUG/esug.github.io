! Phuzzing: a Pharo toolkit for automatic fuzz testing

Guillermo Polito (guillermo.polito@inria.fr)

""Abstract:""
In this talk I will present the first steps on an (ongoing) fuzz testing toolkit for Pharo.

Fuzz testing is a testing technique that automatically generates inputs for programs, with the objective of challenging their implementations and find bugs.
There are, however, different ways to apply fuzz testing, ranging from completely random generation, to profile-guided generation.

In this presentation we will showcase the library by using real cases, and generating real test scenarios for them.
Who knows? Maybe we find a bug.
