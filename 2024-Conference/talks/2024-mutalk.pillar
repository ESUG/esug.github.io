""Abstract:""
Automated testing is a popular technique to validate the correctness of programs.
Tests specify the expected behaviour of a program, are used to guide program design with techniques such as TDD.
Once written, they work as regression detectors: they tell us when bugs are introduced.

However, as developers can introduce bugs in a program, they can also introduce them in the tests.
