! The Pharo Debugger and Debugging Tools: Advances and Roadmap

Steven Costiou  (steven.costiou@inria.fr)

""Abstract:""
In the past three years, the Pharo debugger has evolved and improved a lot.
We have worked towards improving its features and stability, as well as building a solid infrastructure to conduct scientific and technological research on top of it.
In return, we transfer our most stable and promising tools back into the debugger, therefore, we hope, improving user experience.

In this talk, we describe the debugger infrastructure and the new tools we recently integrated.
We also present examples of research prototypes that we are currently working on.
Finally, we propose a roadmap for the next years.

""Bio:""
Steven is an Inria researcher and works in the EVREF team. 
He builds and studies debugging tools to help developers understand their programs and fix bugs.
In this context, his research interests span reflection and meta-programming, object-centric instrumentation, dynamic software adaptation and dynamic languages.

Valentin Bourcier is a PhD student at Inria in the EVREF team since October 2022. 
He studies object-centric debugging, a novel debugging technique that aims at lowering the cost of debugging object-oriented programs. 
In this context, Valentin's main interests are debugging methodologies, debugging techniques, especially object-centric instrumentation 
but also other techniques based on language analysis or language features such as reflection.
