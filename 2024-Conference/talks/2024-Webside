Abstract: Webside (https://github.com/guillermoamaral/Webside) is an API aimed at standarizing a way to talk to a Smalltalk system through HTTP. It also comes with one possible application: a fully operational IDE.
During the presentation at ESUG 22 (NoviSad), questions around the extensibility of such IDE arose.
In this talk, I'm going to present the progress in that regard, together with other improvements made since that presentation in the context a real development enviroment.
Bio: Guille is the creator of Webside. He has been devoted to Smalltalk for more than 20 years, using and enjoying it throughout his entire academic and professional career.
He is currently working for Quorum Software, a solution provider for the oil & gas industry.
