""Abstract:""
Most Smalltalk dialects now include string classes that can represent Unicode codepoints. However, the way in which different dialects provide this can differ quite a bit. This presentation will give a general overview of the implementations in VAST, Pharo, GemStone, and Cuis, with an extra focus on Unicode string hashing, comparing the design choices and tradeoffs involved.
