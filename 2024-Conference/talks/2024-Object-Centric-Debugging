""Abstract:""
Object-Centric Debugging is a technique that focuses debugging tools on objects rather than on the call stack.
Object-centric breakpoints are already available in Pharo since 2019.
Recently we conducted an empirical experiment to study the impact of object-centric breakpoints and the results are encouraging.
In this talk, we will take the opportunity to present again the object-centric breakpoints, then we will discuss the preliminary findings of our experiment.
Additionally, we aim to share our perspective on object-centric debugging, advocating for its expansion beyond breakpoints within Pharo and discussing why and how we should pursue this advancement.


""Bio:""
Steven is an Inria researcher and works in the EVREF team. 
He builds and studies debugging tools to help developers understand their programs and fix bugs.
In this context, his research interests span reflection and meta-programming, object-centric instrumentation, dynamic software adaptation and dynamic languages.

Valentin Bourcier is a PhD student at Inria in the EVREF team since October 2022. 
He studies object-centric debugging, a novel debugging technique that aims at lowering the cost of debugging object-oriented programs. 
In this context, Valentin's main interests are debugging methodologies, debugging techniques, especially object-centric instrumentation 
but also other techniques based on language analysis or language features such as reflection.
