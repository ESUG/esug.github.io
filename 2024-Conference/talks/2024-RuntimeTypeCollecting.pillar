! Runtime type collection and its usage in code transpiling

Pavel Krivanek (krivanek@nidea.cz)

""Abstract:""

While Pharo significantly benefits from the flexibility and expressiveness of strong, dynamic typing, in some cases, the static type annotations of code can play an irreplaceable role. In this presentation, we will discuss our approach to adding type annotations to existing code with the help of runtime type collection based on the Metalinks infrastructure. We will then demonstrate how we utilized these annotations for the successful transpiling of Pharo code to a statically typed language.
