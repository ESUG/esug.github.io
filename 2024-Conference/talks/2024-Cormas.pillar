Oleksandr Zaitsev (oleksandr.zaitsev@cirad.fr)

"Abstract:"
Cormas is an agent-based modelling platform developed in Pharo which is particularly well-suited for the companion modelling approach. In my presentation, I will talk about the recent progress in the development of Cormas: migration to Spec2 and Pharo 12, reducing the dependencies, better UI. I will also present the roadmap for improving Cormas by making it more accessible for researchers with limited programming skills and for local stakeholders.
