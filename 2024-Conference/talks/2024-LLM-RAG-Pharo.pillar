""Abstract"":
Last year, Large Language Model (LLM) have taken  the spotlight in many fields with their ability to generate text in an intelligent manner. 
In computer science, they are being used to generate code, documentation, and also to explain any code base. 
These use cases rely on a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). 
This technique relies on retrieving the relevant document or code just in time to perform the task. 
In this work, we explore RAG to study their use in the onboarding of developers toward new technologies. 
As beginner in Pharo ourselves, we have developped a RAG on the Pharo code base and tested it on a set of questions from the official Pharo Discord where many new developers go to seek answer from the community. 
In this talk, we present a quick overview of LLM and how to build a RAG on any given documents (e.g., Pharo source code and public books of Pharo). 
Then, we demonstrate the ability of RAG to automatically help onboarding pharo users, based on previous questions found in the Pharo Discord.  

""Bio"": 
Pascal Zaragoza has a PhD in computer science from the university of Montpellier. 
His thesis was on the migration of monolithic architecture toward microservice using model driven engineering. 
Since 2022, he works on integrating AI/LLM inside the workflow of Berger-Levrault products. 
Marius Pingaud is a computer science student in this first year of master at the university of Sorbonne Paris. 
He is also a part time intern at Berger-Levrault, under the supervision of Phd Pascal Zaragoza. 
His work focuses on the development of a RAG platform for Berger-Levrault and he explores the RAG ability to accelerate the onboarding of new developers.
