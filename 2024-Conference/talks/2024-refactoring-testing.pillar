! Mutants and refactoring bugs

Balša Šarenac  (balsasarenac@uns.ac.rs)

""Abstract:""
Refactorings need to be reliable, and testing them is one of the most important ways to ensure that they are.
Figuring out all possible edge cases for a given refactoring is not an easy task. 
In this talk, we will present our approach to using automated testing to find bugs in refactorings. 
The talk will cover the design of the approach and how it works in practice.

""Bio:""
