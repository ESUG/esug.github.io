! Process Details

Let #(x y z) be a collection of votes for every candidate.

-x is the number of votes in first place
-y is the number of votes in second place
-z is the number of votes in third place

Then, You should compute:

= (Array with: #(3 x) with: #(2 y) with: #(1 z)) inject: 0 into: [ :result :item | (item at: 1) * (item at: 2) + result]
