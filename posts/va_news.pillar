Dear VA Smalltalk User,

There has been so much going on at Instantiations since the v9.0 release of VA Smalltalk and we've been looking forward to giving you this update. VA Smalltalk 9.0 - Rock Solid Stability!

Last September we launched the v9.0 release of VA Smalltalk which introduced our new 32 & 64-bit virtual machines. Since that time we have been delighted to hear how smoothly our customers are transitioning their production systems to 64-bit technology. The stability of our modernized virtual machines since launch has proven to be fantastic! Instantiations has always taken great care and pride in providing compatible and stable software to help protect our customers' investments as they move their systems forward.
