The goals of the workshop is to create a forum around advances or experience in Smalltalk and to trigger discussions and exchanges of ideas.

This year we want to open two different tracks: one research track and one industrial track with less scientific constraints.

We expect papers of three kinds:

- Short position papers describing emerging ideas
- Long research papers with deeper description of experiments and of research results.
- Industrial papers with presentation of real and innovative Smalltalk applications; this kind of paper should enlighten why Smalltalk is really appropriate for your application.

We will not enforce any length restriction.
