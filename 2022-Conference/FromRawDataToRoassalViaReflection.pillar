! From Raw Data To Roassal Via Reflection

""Abstract:""
Our new implementation of a document management system needs many different visual representations of the same persistent business data. Roassal GUIs are generated based on configurable descriptions over several layers of abstraction. In the presentation we introduce a reflective approach as lowest layer directly above of all application data. Configuration of this layer does not only support formatting of plain data according to specific needs, but also includes control of handling references between the different main types. Examples show the variety of data views that can be created without need to extend application code.
