""Abstract:""
Lifeware, founded in 1998 in Switzerland, provides a web based solution for the management of life insurance products accross more than 15 customers.
Since its start, Lifeware adopted the eXtreme Programing mindset: any new feature is specified, designed, coded, tested in a very short cycle. 
Testing is strongly automated. The full suite runs more than 100.000 tests.
On the other hand, customers are mostly used to a waterfall approach, making working with Lifeware not easy for them.
We designed some processes and tools to strenghten this interaction. This talk will present some of them.
