<h3> Lyon</h3>

<p>
Lyon is a French city in the historic Rhône-Alpes region located in the southeast quarter of France, at the confluence of the Rhône and Saône rivers. Lyon was founded in 43 BC by the Romans on a site that the Gauls had occupied since about 600 BC. The Roman city developed rapidly and became the capital of Gaul in 27 B.C. At its peak, in the 2nd century, the city played an important role as a commercial crossroads (gold and wine, among other things) and as an artisanal center of the Empire and was the pride of the emperors, who visited it regularly. It regressed at the same time as the Roman Empire (from the 300s).
</p>
<p>
The name &quot;Lyon&quot; comes from the Latin name of the city Lugdunum, which was gradually reduced to Lyduum, then Lydiuum and then to Lyon from the XIIIth century. It is because it is a homonym of the animal “lion” that the latter was chosen as emblem and not the opposite.
Lyon is one of the most touristic cities in France, known for its gastronomy, its heritage, its architecture, its cultural life, or its soccer team. Lyon is the third largest city in the country, after Paris and Marseille.
</p>
<p>
Lyon holds the title of City of Lights. Indeed, the brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière, often referred to as the Lumière brothers &quot;Les frères Lumière&quot;, settled in Lyon towards the end of the 19th century and began to invent hundreds of cinematographic and photographic processes. They registered the patents and became the parents of what is now called cinema. The Lumière brothers shot the very first film in history in Lyon: &quot;La Sortie des usines Lumière à Lyon&quot;. Today, we still pay tribute to them at the Lumière Institute, in the many Lumière cinemas and with the huge event that is the Light- &quot;Lumière&quot; Festival!
</p>
<p>
Lyon is fast and direct, regardless of the mode of transportation chosen: air, rail or road.
