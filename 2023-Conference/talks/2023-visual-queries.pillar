""Abstract:""
Visual database queries is a show case about how ApptiveGrid enables users on the web to define custom database queries and how they are executed. Instead of having micro-DSLs for a lot of individual actions we use a small DSL as ubiqituous execution layer from web frontend to database record on disk.

""Bio:""
Norbert Hartl is co-founder of ApptiveGrid. ApptiveGrid is a nocode/lowcode-platfrom for collaboration and process automation where he works on less common ways to enable users to do custom and powerful things.
