! Documentation as a first-class citizen

""Abstract:""
Maintaining up-to-date documentation is a critical, yet often overlooked component of software systems. In this presentation, we will discuss our methodology for generating documentation during the development process or when exploring unfamiliar codebases. We will also introduce the tools we have designed for this purpose, developed in collaboration with the INRIA RMoD team. Finally, we will examine the potential implications of our approach on the Pharo metamodel.
