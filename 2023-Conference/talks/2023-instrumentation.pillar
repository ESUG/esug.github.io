! Code instrumentation and the pitfalls of abstraction

""Abstract:""
In this talk, we are going to understand the endeavours of building a robust instrumentation library.

Let them be bytecode instrumentation, method wrappers, or interception of message passing, all instrumentation libraries have traditionally suffered from meta-circularities.
However, the folklore tells that meta-circularities arise when instrumenting code that is *special*, *low-level* or *core*.
We will see that contrary to that common belief, meta-circularities arise even in the simplest instrumentations.
Our most precious abstraction --every computation is carried out by messages-- is at the core of such difficulty, and the hooks provided by the language implementation (does not understand, cannot interpret, run:with:in:) leave all responsibility to the developer.

We will show the design of an instrumentation support library that is tightly integrated with the language and helps instrumentation library developers build robust implementations.
Finally, we will show how this library can help us build tools such as code coverage and profilers.
