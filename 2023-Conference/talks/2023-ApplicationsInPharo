! Building Applications for Desktop

P. Tesone  (pablo.tesone@inria.fr)

""Abstract:""
Pharo is a great environment to develop desktop applications. 
The Pharo Ecosystem is rich in frameworks and libraries to implement nice looking (and behaving) applications.
In this talk, we are going to present how to take those applications and generates a package that we can distribute to our users.
We need to handle the build of them, the packaging and the integration with the operating system.
