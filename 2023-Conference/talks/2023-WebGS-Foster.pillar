! WebGS: Building a Backend for Modern Web Applications

James Foster  (James.Foster@GemTalkSystems.com)

""Abstract:""
A modern web application is typically implemented as a Single Page Application (SPA) in JavaScript (or something that translates to JavaScript), using a framework such as Angular, Flutter, React, or Vue. These applications often use AJAX (with Json rather than XML) to make calls to a server that supports REST or a similar API over HTTP.

In this tutorial we walk through the steps to install GemStone/S 64 Bit on your machine and use WebGS to serve data. We will look at a variety of use cases, including Web Sockets, for the front-end and the backend. 

""Bio:""
