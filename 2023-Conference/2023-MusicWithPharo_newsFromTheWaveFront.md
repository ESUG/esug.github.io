# Music with Pharo: news from the wavefront #
## Domenico Cipriani ##
### Abstract: ###

Since its first inception in 2020, the experimental Live coding package to program music on-the-fly with Pharo has been consistently growing and being used in many performances and compositions including _Lucretio_'s performance at the _International Live Coding Conference_ (_ICLC2023_) satellite event in Düsseldorf and for the _Rage Therapy_ live at _Tresor_ Berlin.
After the addition of a port of the PortMidi library by Antoine Delaby (a graduating student of Lille University - tutored by Santiago Bragangolo), the most effort in the last months has been focused in a more economic syntax, in the addition of methods for the creation of euclidean rhythms and musical scales and arpeggios, and the support for live rendering of basic GUI elements both for MIDI and Open Sound Control (OSC). Also, it is now possible to visualise the patterns created inside a Performance with Roassal.
I will illustrate the latest development and of the LiveCoding package and the future project of simple API to use Pharo as a backend for the _SuperDirt audio engine_ of the _Super Collider_ programming language.
Finally I will discuss how Pharo could be used to construct audio objects on the Super Collider audio server (_scsynth_).

#### Live Performance: ####
"_MIDI can remember it for you_"
A 60 minutes upbeat audiovisual  performance for Pharo, a couple of _Elektron_ MIDI music devices and Roassal, exploring the interrelation of fast paced repetitive rhythms and false memory.

##### Camp Smalltak Activity: #####
I would like to have the possibility to do a short interactive workshop at Camp Smalltalk on how music can be programmed _on-the-fly_ with Pharo and SuperCollider.

### Bio: ###
Domenico Cipriani a.k.a. Lucretio has been releasing  raw minimalist dance music for more than a decade and with his label Restoration  has played an active role in the vinyl resurgence of the late 2000.
After his graduation at the S.A.E. Institute of Barcelona, he has further developed his research on social semiotic with an M.A. in Linguistics at the University of Padova, focusing on an evolutionary approach to explaining language change. He has discovered Smalltalk with Symbolic Sound Kyma in 2016. In 2019, he presented at the _>>Sonic Experiments<<_ festival at the _ZKM_ an interactive performance based on network distributed Open Sound Control. He has been live coding with Kyma and Pharo since April 2020. He is currently developing independent audio lug-ins and apllications with C++ and the _Juce_ library.
