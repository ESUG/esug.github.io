! What a pity - How to get rid of Smalltalk? (A Model-Driven Approach)

Christian Mann (christian.mann@tomcat.de)

""Abstract:""
It’s really a pity: professional systems with commercial background written in Smalltalk are nowadays more or less legacy systems – what in fact means systems to get rid of. Usually they are for several decades in use and quite often still „under construction“; very often, there is a substantial amount of business knowledge „burried“ in these systems and any approach to supersede them hast to start with a quite costly business reengineering phase.
Extracting an object model of all the business classes in the old system might be a start. This is fairly easy for strongly typed programming languages like Java or C++ - but Smalltalk lacks the necessary type information for easy reengineering. Luckily, there are (even open source) systems which may help (<reference to Jan Blicnicenko’s talk>).
A UML model of the business classes may be a basis for a kind of „walking skeleton“ generated with an MDA approach supporting the business analysis necessary for the replacement of the old system... Yes, we know: Model-Driven Architecture isn’t really en vogue anymore – but it works!
