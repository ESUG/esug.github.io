! One rendering tree

""Abstract:"" 
Glamorous Toolkit is built on top of Bloc graphical stack. Bloc is an extensive infrastructure, but at its core it relies on a core property: one rendering tree. In this talk we look at the magic that this property makes possible, ranging from how we built a new live notebook category and how graphs can be intertwined with any widgets.
