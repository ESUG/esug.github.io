RPC in Smalltalk

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) allows applications to communicate between computers. 
The talk will first expose a list of issues raised when connecting different memory spaces, 
then will explore some solutions to handle it, by comparing their different merits: sockets, VW I3, web services 
and more recently gRPC and web sockets.
