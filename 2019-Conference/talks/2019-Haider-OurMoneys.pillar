! Our Moneys

Christian Haider (mail@christianhaider.de)

""Abstract:""
The budgets of communities and countries are the base of all politics: how much money is collected and how is it spent - our money!
Unfortunately, budgets are extensive and complex - difficult to understand. To make things worse: they usually come only in large PDFs. 

The new commercial project "Unsere Gelder" (our moneys) is set out to change this! 
A data catalog for public budget data is going to hold data in all forms (doc, PDF, CSV, XML...) uploaded by anyone. The data will be made available as tables (CSV, SQL) or graphs (RDF) via a public API. Especially the automatic extraction of data tables from PDF documents will be one focus of the project.

The budget data will be presented using special visualizations and navigations for better understanding. Comparisons and rankings will reveal information and context not available today.

The talk will introduce the project and talk about the envisioned design and the business case. For details in German see https://unsere-gelder.de .
