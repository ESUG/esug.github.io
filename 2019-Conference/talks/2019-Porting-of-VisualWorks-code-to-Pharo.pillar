""Abstract:"" 
Porting of a big business application between Smalltalk dialects is an interesting challenge, especially when the original code is still under active development. In this talk, the easy parts, as well as many pitfalls of such process, will be discussed and demonstrated on examples of the aPart and Glorp frameworks. We will show how the Pharo Consortium can provide tremendous support for such a project and what it means for the next Pharo development.
