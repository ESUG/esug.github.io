!Smalltalk Development of Radiographic Software

Abstract: Bayes Inference Engine (BIE) is used to analyze X-Ray or Proton radiation images of test objects. 
It is able to use physics to predict the transmission images and compare with the real images taken. 
The parameters of the forward model are varied by an optimizer to minimize the differences between the predicted and real images. 
Hence, internal shapes and densities of the test objects are inferred non-destructively. 
BIE uses a dataflow visual programming paradigm like LabView or Simulink. 
Icons called glyphs represent data, geometries or operators. 
They are connected by edges which determine the order and direction of computation.
The glyphs can be inspected anytime to see the results of computation which are always up to date.
Users are encouraged to run BIE in the development environment. 
Hence BIE offers the combined power of dataflow, text and GUI programming.

Bio: For the past 30 years Aik-Siong Koh has been in academia, industry and national laboratory. 
He has degrees from Cambridge University, Princeton University and The University of Texas at Austin. 
He has taught, conducted research and supervised graduate students at Texas Tech University and Nanyang Technological University. 
Using Smalltalk, he developed a Multibody Dynamics software which was commercialized with partners. 
The software was embedded in popular CAD systems like AutoCAD, Alibre and SpaceClaim. 
He is currently in Los Alamos National Laboratory and is interested in using Smalltalk in High Performance Computing.
