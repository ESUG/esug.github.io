! Total refactoring of a 25 years old desktop application

Abstract: PDM is a document management system focused on the special needs of civil engineering having been 
continuously developed in VisualWorks®since 1994 by the product owner, Schmidt Ingenieurbüro für Bauwesen, 
supported by several external teams. 
After a long time of productive use and constant further development, the product had to deal with sincere issues: 
database performance, maintainability, OS portability, GUI style, modularity, still incomplete features. 
Instead of trying to improve the existing code base step-by-step, Schmidt now decided to follow a resolute approach: 
full redesign of the database scheme; restart with an application core for document handling only that meets the 
requirements of performance and modularity; immediate migration to Pharo 8 to base the new GUI on Spec2/GTK.
As Pharo was new to the remaining core team of Schmidt and Pharo 8 is still under development, Schmidt contracted 
several parties with deep know-how in special areas to support the whole process. 
This talk will present the most important results of the chosen technical and organizational approach.

Bio: Starting as a freelancer in 1980, Richard has been involved in numerous software projects where he worked 
together closely with more than 600 developers overall. His experience covers business applications as well as tool 
development in Smalltalk, which he started working with in 1992 and where his focus is still on.
