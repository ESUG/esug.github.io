""Abstract:"" 
The goal of this project has been to both refactor the code of the existing completion in Pharo, and come up with a tool that would improve the actual performance. In this presentation we will talk about the different approaches behind the two completions, the importance of using AST in our project, as well as demonstrate the results we've managed to achieve.
