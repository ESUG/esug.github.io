! Transaction handling in Unit Testing
Dirk Nel (dirkOckertNel@gmail.com)

""Abstract:""
For many years we could not simulate transaction handling (GemStone) in the unit tests of our system.
This resulted in subtle bugs slipping into our system which was hard to catch and hard to prevent from occuring again.
Then GemStone implemented nested transactions and we found a way to use them to simulate transaction handling in our unit tests.
This talk is about the little framework that we built in order to accomplish this.
 
""Bio:"" 
I am Dirk Nel from South Africa.  I work on a client liability system that has been around since the early 1990s.
The system was developed in VisualWorks with GemStone as the DB.
My talk will give highlights of our journey with regards to how we do development and specifically looking at
unit testing and transaction handling within those unit tests.
