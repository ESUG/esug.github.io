! UI Test with Spec: the Future is here (hace rato)

""Abstract:""

UI Testing is always a challenging task. 
For example, UI testers should cover UI interactions, application state representation and its corresponding update, windows navigation and UI layouting.
One solution to UI testing involves manual execution of tests (basically, opening the UI and clicking, clicking and more clicking).
On the other side, UI testing frameworks, like Selenium, allow scripting and emulation of such tests but have a steeper learning curve and require a more complex setup.

Easy or not, automated tests are crucial to apply any well-known software engineering task (like TDD or refactorings) that helps keeping a good product quality and a healthy mental state.
In this talk we present how to (almost) effortlessly apply automated unit testing on Spec Applications.
For this, we dive in Specâ€™s architecture and explain how we do test the different concerns with different kind of tests - layouting, presenter behaviour, backend integration.
