""Abstract:""
Languages and frameworks running on virtual machine runtimes are heavily dependent on their performance characteristics. 
And the overall performance is an important part of any production-ready application.
At Instantiations, we continue to push forward with VA Smalltalk VM performance. In this talk I will demonstrate 
the improvements done to the VM using the powerful LLVM framework. I will give additional insights on how we 
achieved fast and efficient native translation of Smalltalk code.
