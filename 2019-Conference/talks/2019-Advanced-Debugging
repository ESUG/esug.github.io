""Abstract:""
Hard and evil bugs are no match for advanced debugging tools:
- Talk to your debugger and script your debugging sessions with Sindarin
- Debug in isolation
- Live reverse-debugging
- A chest to store your precious objects
- PowerAssert Replay: replay your failed assertions
In this presentation, we show research prototypes of advanced debugging tools we are working on.

""Bio:""
Steven Costiou: I am an Inria researcher and I work in the RMoD team. Before that, I worked six years in the industry as a software developer. Today, I do research on software engineering. I work especially on debugging for which I'm interested in different topics: reflection and meta-programming, object-centric instrumentation, dynamic software adaptation, dynamic languages and virtual machines.

Thomas Dupriez: I am a PhD student in the RMoD team. I work on debuggers and debugging tools. I am interested in exception mechanisms and execution manipulation.
