""Abstract:"" 
There is no magic. You rarely get born as a super coder and great system designer. 
No! You may be a bit talented but you have to learn. 
The point is how to learn what is not written in books or taught. 
The solution is simple: gets exposed!

In this talk I will show that 
- contributing to Pharo is easy
- you can be proud about participating
- you can learn ***a lot*** doing it

And I will show that it is addictive and that you can get an impact building a better system.
