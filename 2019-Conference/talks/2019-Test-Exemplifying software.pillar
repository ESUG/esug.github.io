! Exemplifying software

""Abstract:"" 
Examples are like tests, only they return the object. As an example returns an object, it can be combined seamlessly into larger examples through simple message passing. This makes it possible to create a web of examples that explain the system. In this session we describe examples and go deeper into the notion of parameterized examples and their applications.
