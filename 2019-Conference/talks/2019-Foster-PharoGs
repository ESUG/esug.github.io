! Running Pharo in GemStone

James Foster (esug@jgfoster.net)

""Abstract:""
While many Smalltalk libraries and frameworks (such as Seaside) are intentionally portable across dialects maintaining 
fidelity to a portability layer (such as Grease) is somewhat challenging since it is easy to write code that accidentally 
bypasses the portability layer and not discover it till the port is attempted. Also, a portability layer by definition 
contains only things that exist in all dialects, so is a subset and cannot include unique features. 

An alternative approach is to emulate another dialect's virtual machine. For example, a Pharo8.0 "Minimal Image" has 
over 1500 classes with over 26,000 methods, yet "only" (!) 533 of the methods are primitives. Since GemStone 
has a unique ability to host multiple class hierarchies and alternate implementations for the same selector 
in the same class, we will explore how much of Pharo can be run in GemStone. 

If you have a package that run in a Pharo8.0 minimal image, and you want to see it run in GemStone, 
send me instructions for loading it into Pharo and running tests and I'll include it in my presentation!

""Bio:""
As a junior-high student in 1971, James discovered the local universityâ€™s computer center and a life-long obsession 
with computers began. He was introduced to Smalltalk/V for the Mac in the mid-90s, and became a Smalltalk bigot. 
James is teaching undergraduate computer science classes and also serves as VP of Finance & Operations for GemTalk 
Systems. He is a passionate advocate for GemStone and all things Smalltalk.
