! Big Data with Pharo

Matteo Marra ( mmarra@vub.be / [http://soft.vub.ac.be/~mmarra](http://soft.vub.ac.be/~mmarra))

""Abstract:"" 
In this talk I will present Port, a Big Data framework for Pharo, written in Pharo.
It allows parallel remote execution of code either in a Map/Reduce fashion, or usig a Spark-like data structure and API.
Port can be use to execute your code in parallel on multiple pharo images both locally, or on a cluster.

""Bio:"" 
I am a second year PhD student at the Vrije Unversiteit Brussel, and I also work in collaboration with RMoD.
I work on debugging Big Data applications, in particular Map/Reduce or Spark-like applications running on Port, my Big Data framework for Pharo.

""NOTE:""
Please schedule presentation from monday to wednesday. I will not be at ESUG afterwards
