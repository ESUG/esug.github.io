""Abstract:"" In this talk, I will present and demonstrate the new infrastructure that Moose provides for building of custom meta-models of programming languages. I will describe the reasons why we replaced the FAMIX meta-model and show how we use the new Pharo features as stateful traits, slots and Ring meta-model to implement it.

He actively participates in the Pharo open source community with the primary focus on Pharo modularization, bootstrapping and cleaning.
