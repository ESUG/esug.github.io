""Abstract:""
CORMAS (for COmmon-pool Resources and Multi-Agent Systems) is an Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) platform runing on Pharo, dedicated to natural and common-pool resources management. As an open-source
 software, it is used by an international community of researchers
willing to understand the relationships between human societies and
their environment. From recent years, the development of CORMAS has taken an
innovative direction more oriented towards participatory modeling,
i.e. the collective design of models as an appropriate medium for
fostering interdisciplinary and interactive simulation
involving several stakeholders who interact with a simulation by
acting directly on it. 

As our intention is to involve more deeply, various types of
stakeholders (from farmers to scientists and from technicians to
decision makers) into the modeling process, it is necessary to
have an easily adaptable tool to act on the simulation and to
modify the conceptual model on the fly.

CORMAS benefits from all the functionalities offered by Smalltalk,
which opens a space of potentialities much richer than the other
ABM platforms. Its minimalist syntax enables fast
language learning even for non-computer users. As an
immersive OO system, that enables concept reification,
introspection and intercession, Smalltalk promotes rapid and
efficient model prototyping. The power of its debugger allows a
novice modeler to check finely the functioning of his model, but
also to code directly during the execution of a simulation. Thus, 
participatory design of models and interactive simulations
enable to collectively explore medium and long-term scenarios to
better understand how a desired situation may be reached on the
field.

""Bio:""
Pierre Bommel (pierre.bommel@cirad.fr):
I am a modeler scientist at CIRAD. I contribute to promoting the Companion Modeling approach. Through the development of CORMAS, I have been focusing on the development and the use of Multi-Agent Systems for the simulation of renewable resource management issues. Since 2010, I am based in Costa Rica, at the University.
I develop models related to environmental management, such as breeding adaptation of drought in Uruguay or as breeding and deforestation in the Amazon. Nowadays, I am especially interested in collective design of ABM and interactive simulation for assisting role-playing games.

Etienne Delay (etienne.delay@cirad.fr):
I'm a researcher in social geography and spatial modeling. To tackle the scientific challenges proposed by landscape dynamics and cooperation processes, I have developed a research methodology based on field work and companion modeling combined with the formalization of the observed processes and agents based models.
This approach offers the possibility to understand: spatial, social, cultural and / or economic conditions that take place in territories, and to provide prospective scenarios. My technical expertise grew and evolved through investment in several workgroups: MAPS Team (Modeling Applied to Space Phenomena), OpenMole, OSGeo-international, various initiatives around modeling, exploration and sensibility analysis of spatial patterns behaviors, and more generally in Free Software communities.
