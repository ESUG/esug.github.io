Gabriel Omar Cotelli (g.cotelli@gmail.com)

""Abstract:"" This talk presents Willow, a Web Interaction Library that provides all the components and tools to create an interactive AJAX-based web application, without leaving the comfort of your Smalltalk environment.
After years of refinement and with a growing ecosystem of related projects, Willow is currently used by software development companies, personal commercial products and university research projects.
We will focus on presenting the user interaction affordances, while also showcasing its features and the most relevant reifications for web commands and components.
