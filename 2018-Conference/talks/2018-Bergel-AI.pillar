Alexandre Bergel (Alexandre.Bergel@me.com)

""Abstract:"" This tutorial is an introduction to three common techniques in the field of artificial intelligence. First, we will detail neural networks and see a number of applications of them. Second, we will review what are genetic algorithms and how they are useful in optimization and searching. Third, we will combine neural networks and genetic algorithm to define an unsupervised form of learning, which we call neuroevolution. We will see numerous example of data classification and artificial player in games. The time of this tutorial is 2 hours.
